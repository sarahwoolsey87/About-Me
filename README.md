# Reading-Notes

Tuesday: 
I wrote the content in basic HTML and added some text boxes, along with a prompt, name input and alert. I also created a series of  yes/no (true/false) questions.

Wednesday: I used a While loop for an random number (maths.random) game and created an array to ask the user to guess one of the coolest countries I'd been to (3 possible answers)

Thursday: 
Updated some styling on CSS. Chidi (Navigator) reviewed  problems with me and gave me advice on code to change/tidy up - applied changes those (landing page update, use of containers, CSS organisation etc). I also changed all the questions to functions (and invocations) as per the lab task. I added 'Flex' on Chidi's suggestion to position my social media buttons.
I watched this video to help with my boxes (but it required a lot of repairs and experimentation with Flex!)

Issues I'm having with the code:

Why won't my Header center? I've tried so many things.

Reminder on linking Google fonts?
